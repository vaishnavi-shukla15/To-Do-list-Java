1. JavaFX Application Structure:
The code defines a JavaFX application with a main class "HelloApplication" that extends Application. The main method main launches the application.

2. UI Elements and Layout:
The application's user interface consists of various UI elements organized in a BorderPane layout.

UI Elements:
TextField for entering task names.
DatePicker for selecting task deadlines.
ComboBox elements for selecting the hour, minute, and AM/PM of the deadline.
Button for adding tasks.
ListView for displaying the list of tasks.
Layout:
VBox for organizing input elements vertically.
HBox for organizing time-related elements horizontally.
BorderPane for the main layout with input elements on the left and the task list in the center.
3. Task Class:
There's a separate Task class representing a task with a name, deadline, and completion status. It includes methods to check if the deadline is reached (isDeadlineReached) and to display a reminder (displayReminder).

4. Task Management:
The HelloApplication class manages a list of tasks (List<Task> tasks) and provides methods to add tasks (addTask), update the task list view (updateTaskListView), and check for deadlines (checkDeadlines).

5. Timeline and Periodic Checks:
A Timeline is used to check for deadlines every 5 seconds. The checkDeadlines method is called periodically to identify tasks with reached deadlines and display reminders.

6. Java Time API:
The code uses the java.time package for working with dates and times. It includes classes like LocalDate, LocalDateTime, LocalTime, and DateTimeFormatter for managing task deadlines.

7. UI Event Handling:
The addButton has an event handler (e -> {...}) that adds a task when clicked. It calls the addTask method, updates the task list view, and clears the input fields.

8. Alert Dialogs:
The Alert class is used to display information or error messages in dialog boxes. It is used in the addTask method to notify the user if they attempt to set a deadline in the past.

Technologies and Dependencies:
The primary technologies used in this code are:

JavaFX: A framework for building Java-based user interfaces.

Java Time API (java.time): Introduced in Java 8, it provides improved date and time handling compared to the older Date and Calendar classes.

There are no external dependencies beyond the standard Java libraries, as this code is based on core Java and JavaFX functionality.
